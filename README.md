# Housing Dataset Analysis

This repository contains the analysis of the housing dataset using scikit-learn. The primary goal is to replace GridSearchCV with RandomizedSearchCV in a single pipeline for data preparation and final prediction. Additionally, a transformer is added to select the most important attributes.
## Project Goals:

1. **Replace exhaustive GridSearchCV with more efficient RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization**
2. **Unified Data Preparation and Prediction Pipeline**
3. **Feature Importance Integration**

This project aims to optimize hyperparameter tuning, streamline the workflow via a unified pipeline, and incorporate feature selection for improved model performance using scikit-learn in a housing dataset context.

# Customer Churn Cluster Analysis

Customer churn, indicating the rate at which customers stop using a service or product within a defined period, is the primary focus of this analysis. The aim is to comprehend and mitigate churn, leading to improved business retention strategies.
Addressing churn is critical as acquiring new customers is typically more expensive than retaining existing ones. Minimizing churn can significantly impact revenue and ensure business stability.

## Project Goals:

1. **Segmentation via Cluster Analysis**
2. **Churn Prediction and Understanding**
3. **Strategy Development for Churn Mitigation**
4. **Business Impact Assessment**
5. **Insights Communication**
